---------------------------------------------------
#You can think of a class as a piece of code that specifies the data and behavior that represent and model a particular type of object.
#A common analogy is that a class is like the blueprint for a house. You can use the blueprint to create several houses and even a complete neighborhood.
 Each concrete house is an object or instance that’s derived from the blueprint.
#Each instance can have its own properties, such as color, owner, and interior design. (object state)
Instances can also have different behaviors, such as locking the doors and windows, opening the garage door, turning the lights on and off, watering the garden
#member of class(object) is attributes and methods
#you can use classes to create objects that emulate people, animals, vehicles, books, buildings, cars, or other objects.
 You can also model virtual objects, such as a web server, directory tree, chatbot, file manager, and more.
#The .__init__() method has a special meaning in Python classes. 
This method is known as the object initializer because it defines and sets the initial values for your attributes.
#The action of creating concrete objects from an existing class is known as instantiation. With every instantiation, you create a new object of the target class. 
#To create an object of a Python class like Circle, you must call the Circle() class constructor with a pair of parentheses and a set of appropriate arguments.
#In Python, the class constructor accepts the same arguments as the .__init__() method.
# you can access the attributes and methods of an object by using dot notation with the dot operator : obj.attribute_name, obj.method_name()
#use dot notation and an assignment statement to change the current value of an attribute
#Most Python programmers follow the snake_case naming convention, which involves using underscores (_) to separate multiple words. However,
 the recommended naming convention for Python classes is the PascalCase, where each word is capitalized.
#The naming convention consists of adding a leading underscore to the member’s name. So, in a Python class:
Member		Naming					Examples
Public		Use the normal naming pattern.		radius, calculate_area()
Non-public	Include a leading underscore in names.	_radius, _calculate_area()
#Public members are part of the official interface or API of your classes, while non-public members aren’t intended to be part of that API.
 This means that you shouldn’t use non-public members outside their defining class.
#It’s important to note that the second naming convention only indicates that the attribute isn’t intended to be used directly from outside the containing class.
 It doesn’t prevent direct access
#n most cases, attributes should be non-public to guarantee the safe use of your classes.
 A good approach will be to start with all your attributes as non-public and only make them public if real use cases appear.
#Another naming convention that you can see and use in Python classes is to add two leading underscores to attribute and method names.
 This naming convention triggers what’s known as name mangling.
#benefit of classes:Model and solve complex real-world problems,Reuse code and avoid repetition,
Encapsulate related data and behaviors in a single entity,Abstract away the implementation details of concepts and objects,
Unlock polymorphism with common interfaces
#Python classes can help you write more organized, structured, maintainable, reusable, flexible, and user-friendly code
#sometimes using a class isn’t the best solution. Sometimes a couple of functions are enough.
#Data classes, enumerations, and named tuples are specially designed to store data. So, they might be the best solution 
if your class doesn’t have any behavior attached.
#f your class has a single method in its API, then you may not require a class. Instead, 
use a function unless you need to retain a certain state between calls.
#***classes are great when you must bundle data and behavior together in a single entity***
###Atributes:
#Class attributes: A class attribute is a variable that you define in the class body directly. Class attributes belong to their containing class.
 Their data is common to the class and all its instances.
#Instance attributes: An instance is a variable that you define inside a method. Instance attributes belong to a concrete instance of a given class.
 Their data is only available to that instance and defines its state.
#You can’t modify class attributes through instances of the containing class. 
Doing that will create new instance attributes with the same name as the original class attributes. 
#you should use class attributes for sharing data between instances of a class. Any changes on a class attribute will be visible to all the instances of that class.
#Instance Attributes:Instance attributes are variables tied to a particular object of a given class. 
The value of an instance attribute is attached to the object itself.
#Unlike class attributes, you can’t access instance attributes through the class. You need to access them through their containing instance
#special attribute called .__dict__. This attribute holds a dictionary containing the writable members of the underlying class or instance.
#you can add new attributes to your classes and instances dynamically. you can take advantage of this Python feature when you don’t know the 
required attributes of a given class at the time when you’re defining that class itself.
## property and descriptor-based attribute:Python allows you to add function-like behavior on top of existing instance attributes and
 turn them into managed attributes.
 # with managed attributes, you can have function-like behavior and attribute-like access at the same time.
 # To create a managed attribute with function-like behavior in Python, you can use either a property or a descriptor, 
 depending on your specific needs.
 #light weight class : with __slot__ the memory for instance of a class is so smaller than regular instance.
 # This attribute prevents the automatic creation of an instance .__dict__.
 # The .__slots__ attribute adds a second interesting behavior to your custom classes. It prevents you from 
 adding new instance attributes dynamically
 # You’ll use the data to define the object’s current state and the methods to operate on that data or state.
 #in a Python class, you can define three different types of methods
 ## Instance methods, which take the current instance, self, as their first argument
 ## Class methods, which take the current class, cls, as their first argument
 ## Static methods, which take neither the class nor the instance
 #Instance Methods With self: The self argument holds a reference to the current instance, allowing you to access that 
 instance from within methods. 
 #Special Methods and Protocols:
 #Python supports what it calls special methods, which are also known as dunder or magic methods.
 #These methods are typically instance methods, and they’re a fundamental part of Python’s internal class mechanism
 # Python calls them automatically in response to specific operations.
 #For example, the .__str__() and .__repr__() methods provide string representations for your objects.
 #The .__str__() method provides what’s known as the informal string representation of an object. This method must 
 return a string that represents the object in a user-friendly manner.
 #A class method is a method that takes the class object as its first argument instead of taking self.
 #You can create class methods using the @classmethod decorator
 #Your Python classes can also have static methods.
 #they’re regular functions defined within a class. You could’ve also defined them 
 outside the class as stand-alone function.
 #You’ll typically define a static method instead of a regular function outside the class 
 when that function is closely related to your class,and you want to bundle it together for 
 convenience or for consistency with your code’s API.
 #Remember that calling a function is a bit different from calling a method. To call a method, 
 you need to specify a class or object that provides that method.
 #Getter and Setter Methods vs Properties:
 #Using methods to access and update attributes promotes encapsulation. Encapsulation is a fundamental OOP principle
  that recommends protecting an object’s state or data from the outside world, preventing direct access.
 #special class:
 #if you want a tool that saves you from writing a lot of class-related boilerplate code, then you can take advantage of 
 data classes and the dataclasses module.
#if you’re looking for a tool that allows you to quickly create class-based enumerations of constants,
 then you can turn your eye to the enum module and its different types of enumeration classes.
 #Python’s data classes specialize in storing data.
